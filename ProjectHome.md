Babel is a language for talking with computers.  It is a knowledge representation language that aims to be as expressive as most natural language.  It is a formal grammar for representing thoughts and the meaning of human languages.

Babel is modeled after traditional computer programming languages that provide for terse, human readable and easy to write code.

Parsing natural language is a hard problem, but it can be avoided by writing Babel.  By using this format natural language processing (NLP) can be separated from the real artificial intelligence work.  Babel provides a way to divide the two challenges.

Babel is not a representation of parsed natural language.  It is designed to represent specific meaning and does not include many of the subtleties of natural language.  Babel does not try to model natural language completely.  The aim is simply to be able to represent the meaning of most natural language.
